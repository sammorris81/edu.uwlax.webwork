Here we            present the most common problems and advice on how to avoid            them.        </p>        <p>            Before getting to the common complaints, we            note that in most cases, problems can be avoided by doing three things:            <font size="+1">            <ol>                <li>Start working on your homework early; you can then                fix problems before an assignment is due.                </li>                <li>Use the <b>Preview</b> button to see how WeBWorK has                parsed your answer.                </li>                <li>When you are having trouble, get help from a person (your                teacher, a teaching assistant, or a classmate).                </li>            </ol>            </font>            The third suggestion is probably the most important.  WeBWorK            will show you which problems you are having difficulty with.  It            is then up to you to get help with them.  If you have started            early, you can still get the problems right.                        <hr>        </p>        <h3>Complaint: It would help to have a list of the functions/notations        WeBWorK accepts.</h3>        <p>            <blockquote> When WeBWorK gives the list of problems for an            assignment, it usually gives a link to the list on the right            side of the page.  It is: <a            href="availableFunctions.html">List            of available functions</a>            </blockquote>        </p>        <h3>Complaint: I prefer to do my homework on paper.</h3>        <p>            <blockquote>                So do we!  WeBWorK does not require students to work out the                problems at their computer.  We recommend that students print                out the assignments and work out the problems on paper.  Then                enter the answers into WeBWorK.            </blockquote>        </p>         <h3>Complaint: It is frustrating to keep guessing at answers</h3>        <p>            <blockquote>                No one expects students to repeatedly guess at their                homework answers.  If you are having problems, consult a                person who might be able to help, be it your teacher, a teaching assistant, or a classmate.            </blockquote>        </p>        <h3>Complaint: It would be better if a teacher graded my homework so I could        see where I was going wrong.</h3>        <p>            <blockquote>                <p>                    It would be nice to have a teacher                    grade your homework problems and indicate exactly where you                    went wrong.  But, for classes that use WeBWorK, most paper                    homeworks could only be spot checked (i.e., a small percentage                    were marked right/wrong by a grader).                </p>                <p>                    You <b>can</b> get this sort of help when doing                    WeBWorK problems.  When you are getting a problem wrong in                    WeBWorK, you should get help from a teaching assistant or from your                    instructor.  By bringing your work, they can help you find                    where you went wrong.  If you start your homework early, you                    can do this and still submit the right answer before the due                    date.  That way, you get help on the problems you are                    getting wrong <em>and</em> can still get them right.                </p>            </blockquote>        </p>        <h3>Complaint: WeBWorK won't accept my answer unless I enter it in a special form.</h3>        <p>            <blockquote>                <p>                    WeBWorK uses standard mathematical notation as much as                    possible, and it accepts answers entered in many different                    forms, as long as they are correct.  If you have examples                    where this is not the case, bring it to the attention of                    your teacher, so he or she can take it to the WeBWorK                    administrators.                </p>            </blockquote>        </p>                        <hr>    <address>Adapted from a document created by John Jones, ASU.</address><!-- Created: Mon May 19 14:12:26 MST 2003 --><!-- hhmts start -->Last modified: Wed Aug 01 12:36:45 EST 2008<!-- hhmts end -->  </body></html>
