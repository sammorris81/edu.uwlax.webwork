For example(1+2)*(3+4) and (1+2)(3+4) are both valid. So are 3*4 and 3&nbsp;4 (3space 4, not 34) but using a * makes things clearer.                <LI> Use ('s and )'s to make your meaning clear. You can also use ['sand ]'s and &#123;'s and &#125;'s.                <LI> Don't enter 2/4+5 (which is 5.5) when you really want 2/(4+5)(which is 2/9).                <LI> Don't enter 2/3*4 (which is 8/3) when you really want 2/(3*4)(which is 2/12).                <LI> Entering big quotients with square brackets,e.g. [1+2+3+4]/[5+6+7+8], is a good practice.                <LI> Be careful when entering functions. It's always good practice touse parentheses when entering functions. Write  sin(t) instead of sint or sin t.  But WeBWorK is smart enought to  accept sin t or even sint.  But  sin 2t is really sin(2)t, i.e. (sin(2))*t. Be careful.                <LI> Understand that sin^2t is really short hand for (sin(t))^2 and must be entered this way. Actually you could enter it assin(t)^2 or even sint^2, but don't try such things unless you reallyunderstand the precedence of operations.                <LI> For example 2+3sin^2(4x) is wrong. You need to enter something like: 2+3(sin(4x))^2 or 2+3sin(4x)^2. Why  does the lastexpression work? Because things in parentheses are always done first [ i.e. (4x)], next all functions, such as sin, are evaluated[giving sin(4x)], next all exponents are taken [giving sin(4x)^2], next all multiplications and divisions are performed [giving 3sin(4x)^2], and finally all additions and subtractions are performed [giving 2+3sin(4x)^2].                <LI> The complete rules for the precedence of operations, in additionto the above, are                <UL>                    <LI> Multiplications and divisions are performed left to                    right: 2/3*4 = (2/3)*4 = 8/3.                        <LI> Additions and subtractions are performed left to right: 1-2+3 =(1-2)+3 = 2.                        <LI> Exponents are taken right to left: 2^3^4 = 2^(3^4) = 2^81 = a bignumber.                        </UL>                            <LI> Use the &quot;Preview Button&quot; to see exactly how your entry looks.
