BEGIN_TEXT

The heights of young women in the United States are approximately normally distributed, with mean 64.8in. The heights of the 8 players on a recent roster of the WNBA Chicago Sky basketball team are $x1, $x2, $x3, $x4, $x5, $x6, $x7, $x8. Is there significant evidence to say that the mean height of these 8 players is so much larger than the population mean that the difference cannot reasonably be attributed to chance alone?
