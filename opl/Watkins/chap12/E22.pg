BEGIN_TEXT
Obesity is associated with many long-term illnesses, such as diabetes and hypertension.
In a Swedish study, a group of subjects who had undergone surgery for obesity
were followed over a 10-year period and compared, over that time, to a sample of
conventionally treated control subjects.
The table below gives the summary counts from the study.

$PAR
\{
  LayoutTable(
    [
      [[' ', midrule => 1], 'Developed Diabetes', 'No Diabetes', 'Total'],
      ['Surgery', "$o1", "$o2", "$r1"],
      [['Control Group', midrule => 1], "$o3", "$o4", "$r2"],
      ['Total', "$c1", "$c2", "$total"]
    ],
    align => 'l | c c | c',
    allcellcss => 'padding:3pt;'
  );
\}

$PAR
Give your answers to three decimal places.
\{ BeginList( "OL", type=>"a") \}
  $ITEM What is the expected count of those patients who $group? \{ans_rule(10)\}
  $ITEM What is the test statistic to determine if the surgery has an impact on the diabetes status?
  \{ ans_rule(10) \}.
  $ITEM What are the appropriate degrees of freedom for this test statistic? \{ ans_rule(10) \}
  $ITEM The p-value for this test is \{ ans_rule(10) \}. (If p-value \(< 0.001\),
  enter 0)
  $ITEM Select the appropriate decision for this hypothesis test (use \( \alpha = $alpha \)). $BR
  \{ $mcdec -> buttons() \} $PAR
  $ITEM Select the appropriate interpretation for this hypothesis test
  (use \(\alpha = $alpha\)). $BR
  \{ $mcinterp -> buttons() \} $PAR
  $ITEM If an error had been made on this test, what kind of error would it have been?
